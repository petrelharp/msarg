**msarg** : some `R` infrastructure to run `ms` simulations on grids
====================================================================

Here are some S4 classes and some methods for building up demographic models on spatial grids
that change over time,
along with methods to write these out as command-line parameters for `ms`.

Have a look at the examples:

1. Appearance, and disappearance, of [a barrier](barrier-howto.html)
2. [Parallel universes](parallel-universes-howto.html)
3. Sudden appearance, and gradual retreat, of [a glacier](glaciation-howto.html)

... and there's a bit more documentation, sort of in [this document](using-msarg.html).
